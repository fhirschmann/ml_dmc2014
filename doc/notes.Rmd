# DMC 2010 Notes

The task is to classify the target attribute ``target90`` (binary classification). If this
attribute is ``yes``, then no vouchers are given out and vice versa. So, the decision to
give out vouchers really is the inverse of ``target90``.

## Baseline

The baseline can be constructed by giving out a voucher all the time:

```{r baseline}
dmc.points(rep("no", nrow(dt)), dt$target90)
```

## Cost-Sensitivity

The problem at hand is a cost-sensitive classification problem, and
the cost matrix is given by

```{r cost}
dmc.cost
```

where columns correspond to the true classes and rows are the predicted class.
Diagonal elements are ignored, so it needs to be normalized.
